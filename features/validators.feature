Feature: Data validators and output format
  Each validatable HTTP component can be validated with several validators. Usage of a particular validator for a particular HTTP component depends on the format of data used for expression of the expectation.

  @stable @nodejs
  Scenario: Validators output format
  Output JSON keys description:

    **realType**  - required - Media Type of real data
    **expectedType** - optional - Media Type of expected (example) data used for validation
    **validator**  - optional - Data validator used for real and expected data comparison
    **results** - required -  Validation result errors and warnings
    **rawData** - optional - Raw output from the data validator

    When you perform a failing validation on any validatable HTTP component
    Then the validator output for the HTTP component looks like the following JSON:
    """
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "pointer": "/c",
          "severity": "error",

        }

  Scenario: Text diff validator
    **Text diff validator** is used to compare textual data. Output is in the format used in [Google Diff, Match and Patch libraries for Plain Text][] which is similar to GNU diff's unidiff format (`diff -u`).

  [Google Diff, Match and Patch libraries for Plain Text]: https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/wiki/Unidiff

    And you express expected data by the following "text/plain" example:

    """
    And you have the following "text/plain" real data:
    """
    `Churchill` talked about climbing a wall which is leaning toward you and kissing a woman who is leaning away from you.
